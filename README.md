# WCVPNamer v1.0.0

This website uses the `World Checklist of Vascular Plants` to provide accepted names and other data for plants.

The website can be browsed and data extracted by copy and pasting. Alternatively, the website can be used as an API by other software, eg. websites, where accepted plant names are required. Currently the `trees` website, also made by `StevesPages` uses `WCVPNamer` in this way.

This website has been uploaded to `GitHub` without the `SQLite` database because the database is over 100Mb. Ideally the database with some representative data should be uploaded as a useful backup of the database schema.

## Release Notes for v1.0.0

After months of inactivity the project was cloned from GitHub and some minor changes that had been made to the version on the server were committed.
