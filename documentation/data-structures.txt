* li elements produced by display-suggestions.js

*********************************************************************

  First Type:

  If suggestion.taxonomic_status contains "Accepted" or "Artificial Hybrid" or "Unplaced" then the li element will contain a single span element constructed thus:

  Note: taxon = suggestionsTaxonAndNumber.taxon
  Thus taxon = "genus" or "species" or "infraspecies"
  taxon is the taxon rank that was searched for by getSuggestions()

  <li>

    <span

      class = "taxon-name"

      data-kew-id = suggestion.kew_id (eg. "30183-1")

      data-taxon-rank = taxon
                        ("genus" or "species" or "infraspecies")

      data-taxonomic-status = suggestion.taxonomic_status
                              ("accepted" or "artificial-hybrid" or
                               "unplaced")

      data-source = "not-accepted_name"

    >

      innerHTML=
        suggestion[taxon] (eg. "Quercus" or "robur" or "pedunculiflora")
        Note: the innerHTML is always a single word.


      (when span is clicked)
      (only for data-taxonomic-status = "accepted" or "artificial-hybrid")
      <button class = "taxon-option return-taxon">Return</button>
      <button class = "taxon-option switch-taxon">Switch</button>

    </span>

*********************************************************************

  Second Type:

  If suggestion.taxonomic_status contains "Synonym" or "Homotypic_Synonym" then the li element will contain two span elements. The first span element will be the same as the First Type except data-taxonomic-status will contain "synonym" or "homotypic-synonym".

  The second span element is for the taxon referred to in suggestion.accepted_name (this was empty in the First Case). It will be constructed thus:

  Note: suggestionsTaxonAndNumber.taxon is not used here as the taxonomic rank of the referred to in suggestion.accepted_name may be different from the taxon rank that was searched for. It is provided in suggestion.acc_name_tax_rank.

  <li>

    <span

      class = "taxon-name"

      data-kew-id = suggestion.accepted_kew_id (eg. "30183-1")

      data-taxon-rank = suggestion.acc_name_tax_rank
                        ("genus" or "species" or "infraspecies")
                        (Conceivably "family"???)

      data-taxonomic-status = suggestion.acc_name_tax_stat
                              ("accepted" or "artificial-hybrid")

      data-source = "accepted_name"

    >

      innerHTML=
        suggestion.accepted_name (eg. "Quercus" or "Quercus robur")
        Note: the innerHTML is NOT always a single word.


      (when span is clicked)
      (all these spans can be clicked to give taxon-option buttons)
      <button class = "taxon-option return-taxon">Return</button>
      <button class = "taxon-option switch-taxon">Switch</button>

    </span>
